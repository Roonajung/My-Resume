    <h3>Hi! I am Roo Ri Lee from Frankfurt.<br/>

        I am Mom of two lovely daughters and married happily to an amazing husband nearly 15 years.<br/>
        As long as I have an opportunity to learn, I learn. 
       Now I started to learn Web Development, which I really enjoy.<br/>
        When my daily job is done, I open my personal computer and start learning. <br/>
        In this way I am able to think about different things, then the daily tasks.<br/>
        It kind of refreshs my mind. <br/>
        With more than 12 years of work experience in Office Management with two Office removing projects, I can say I am pretty good etablished Office Manager.<br/>
        I am solution driven and always looking for new challenges. <br/>
        It's like a blessing and a curse at the same time.
